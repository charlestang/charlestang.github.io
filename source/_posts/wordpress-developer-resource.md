今天刚看到几个WordPress开发资源，觉得很不错~在这里记录一下。
<!-- more -->
**[WordPress phpDoc](http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/)**

WordPress内部使用phpDoc的语法进行注释，这是WordPress.org为其生成的文档。

**[WP 函数搜索引擎](http://wplookup.com/)**

超级棒的一个功能~ 看看下文的说明。

> I want to quickly let everyone here know of a site that one of my good
> friends, Andy Stratton (http://theandystratton.com), has setup
> recently. The site is called WPLookup and can be found at
> http://wplookup.com/. It provides a simple search box for quick
> lookups of WordPress functions and template tags. If the appropriate
> codex page exists for the function you are looking for it will
> immediately redirect you there. If it does not exist you will be
> directed to a documentation search on http://wordpress.org/search
> which will contain a list of results for you.
> 
> To make it even better the site can also integrate into your browsers
> search bar keeping you from ever having to actually navigate to the
> WPLookup site to do the search.
> 
> I have taken his service one step further and integrated his service
> into an IRC bot. The bot is sitting in #wordpress on freenode. To
> use the bot type something in the form of `.codex get_pages`.
> 
> Now what are you waiting for? Check it out now at http://wplookup.com/.
> 
> Enjoy!
