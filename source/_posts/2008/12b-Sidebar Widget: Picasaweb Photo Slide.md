This plugin is created long time ago.

I built this plugin for one of my friends. But she is now not using it. So I have no reason to improve it.

I put it here and I hope someone will find and like it.

This plugin is just a simple slideshow sidebar widget, the photos it use is in one of your Picasa photo albums.
